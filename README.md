Duels is a restrictions orientated plugin. I developed the this plugin for my Minecraft server to address a player request for controlled, one-on-one battles. Players were looking for a way to duel each other without specific advantages, like using totems, golden apples, bows, shields, potions and etc. Previously, they had to rely on moderators to enforce these restrictions, which caused additional issues, so I created this plugin to solve that issue.


/duel <player> opens the GUI below. You can toggle some of restrictions by clicking on them. When you are done click Start and duel request with the same Restriction properties will be sent to the target.

The DENY/ACCEPT messages are clickable.

When accept the request it teleports you to the arena and starts counting down from 5 to 0

How do we teleport players to spawn? By executing command "/spawn <player>" from console.
